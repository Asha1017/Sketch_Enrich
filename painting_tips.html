      <h2 class="display-1 text-center">Welcome to painting tips!!</h2>
      <p>Painting is a beautiful art of colors. It requires creative skills to paint images on canvas or any other surface. There are various stages of painting that include preparing the surface, under-painting or blocking in colors, laying the paint, and blending colors. Additional layers of paint are applied to the surface in order to build up complex colors. A painting is born from the imagination. Beginners need to get good tips for better painting. Here are some of the tips that make you move ahead.</p>

      <strong class="text-secondary font-weight-bold">1. LEARN THE BASICS OF DRAWING</strong>
      <h5 class="font-italic">This is the first and most important tip. Everything you need to know about the basics of drawing, like composition, anatomy / figure, perspective, volume, light and shading, and so on will serve as a foundation for your paintings.. Without this knowledge, you cannot be called a professional artist.</h5>
      <p class=" h3 text-secondary">2. KEEP UP WITH THE BEST</p>
      <p class="font-italic">Do not compare yourself or your path with anyone. Study and analyze the biographies and works of famous artists only to form your own unique style, not to.</p>
      <h3 class="text-secondary">3. TAKE CRITICISM AS IT IS MERITED</h3>
      <p>A person may simply not understand your work, but if the criticism is constructive, then it may be worth listening to it.</p>
      <h3 class="text-secondary">4. DRAW WISELY</h3>
      <p>If you are just a beginner, think about what you are painting. Take some time to determine what you want to express to others with your creativity.</p>
      <h3 class="text-secondary">5. DRAW WHAT COMES TO YOUR IMAGINATION</h3>
      <p>The need to accurately paint the world around us has long disappeared — almost everyone has a camera or smartphone. Artists have the right to draw abstractly, and to draw anything and everything that comes to mind. So take this opportunity to unleash your creativity!</p>
      <h3 class="text-secondary">6. CONNECT WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE</h3>
      <p>Every creative person knows what it feels like when certain people cater to the influence on inspiration and ability to create. You have the opportunity to get together.</p>
      <h3 class="text-secondary">7. NEVER STOP</h3>
      <p>Learn and work on yourself. Keep cultivating and honing your artistic vision.</p>
      <h3 class="text-secondary">8. DO NOT FIND EXCUSES</h3>
      <p>Anything that should be done, just do it.</p>
      <h3 class="text-secondary">9. READ BOOKS</h3>
      <p>Read not only books specifically about drawing, but also books on art in general. What could be better for gaining inspiration than immersion in others' worlds?</p>
      <h3 class="text-secondary">10. DO NOT NEGLECT TO REST</h3>
      <p>Mental activity depletes one no less than physical activity. Rest can lead to the emergence of new spiritual forces.</p>
      <h3 class="text-secondary">11. GET ENOUGH SLEEP</h3>
      <p>Do not sacrifice radical painting for the same reason. You should think only that you have only thoughts.</p>
      <h3 class="text-secondary">12. DO NOT TRY TO POLISH YOUR DRAWINGS</h3>
      <p>Look at the works of great artists and try to find perfect lines and shapes there. Experiment with form and style, and which techniques you need to use when drawing specific subjects.</p>
      <h3 class="text-secondary">13. ALWAYS TRY NEW THINGS</h3>
      <p>If you like dramas, watch some comedies. If you like rock music, try listening to jazz. New art is an endless resource for inspiration. Don't be conservative and only fixate on one thing.</p>
      <h3 class="text-secondary">14. BE REALISTIC</h3>
      <p>It can't be fast, so do not despair. To achieve your desired result, you need to draw hundreds of human figures.</p>
      <h3 class="text-secondary">15. TRY TO NOTICE EVERYTHING AROUND YOU</h3>
      <p>Go to familiar places and try to find some little things that you have not noticed before. Such training will help you learn to pay attention, be observant, and be mindful.</p>
